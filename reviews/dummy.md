# Review of [Dummy Website](http://dum.my.site.spoof)
## by Matt


## What does the URL tell you?

Well, since the URL is absurd, there's plenty of evidence that not much work went into this.

## What's the Subject Matter?
Since this is a made-up website, I have nothing to say here

## Is it trustworthy?
- Are Sources Documented?
- If links are provided, links to where?
- Any evidence of plagiarism?

## Does Web Publication _enhance_ the storytelling?
- What does the website do that would be _difficult_ to achieve in a linear narrative?
- Is anything _lost_ by non-linear organization?
- How might you suggest _improving_ the site?

## Overall, would you recommend this site to someone interested in the subject matter? To a researcher?
Well, not this site!
